1. To create MANUAL.ps just type  "make".
   If it does not work on you system check/modify "Makefile".

2. "Lman" is a simple script for displaying LEDA manual pages
   on normal terminal screens. It calls "gawk" (GNU awk) and
   reads the awk script "AWK". 


3. "tman" extracts the manual page from the corresponding header
   file, prepares it with latex, and diplays it using xdvi.


You have to change the path names in "tman" and "Lman" in order
to make it work on your system.
