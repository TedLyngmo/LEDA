/* G is a planar map. This procedure triangulates all faces of G
   without introducing multiple edges. The algorithm was suggested by 
   Christian Uhrig and Torben Hagerup. 

   Description:

   Triangulating a planar graph G, i.e., adding edges
   to G to obtain a chordal planar graph, in linear time:
   
   1) Compute a (combinatorial) embedding of G.
   
   2) Step through the vertices of G. For each vertex u,
   triangulate those faces incident on u that have not
   already been triangulated. For each vertex u, this
   consists of the following:
   
     a) Mark the neighbours of u. During the processing
   of u, a vertex will be marked exactly if it is a
   neighbour of u.
   
     b) Process in any order those faces incident on u
   that have not already been triangulated. For each such
   face with boundary vertices u=x_1,...,x_n,
        I)   If n=3, do nothing; otherwise
        II)  If x_3 is not marked, add an edge {x_1,x_3},
             mark x_3 and continue triangulating the face
             with boundary vertices x_1,x_3,x_4,...,x_n.
        III) If x_3 is marked, add an edge {x_2,x_4} and
             continue triangulating the face with boundary
             vertices x_1,x_2,x_4,x_5,...,x_n.
   
     c) Unmark the neighbours of x_1.
   
   Proof of correctness:
   
   A) All faces are triangulated.
   This is rather obvious.
   
   B) There will be no multiple edges.
   During the processing of a vertex u, the marks on
   neighbours of u clearly prevent us from adding a multiple
   edge with endpoint u. After the processing of u, such an
   edge is not added because all faces incident on u have
   been triangulated. This takes care of edges added in
   step II).
   Whenever an edge {x_2,x_4} is added in step III), the
   presence of an edge {x_1,x_3} implies, by a topological
   argument, that x_2 and x_4 are incident on exactly one
   common face, namely the face currently being processed.
   Hence we never add another edge {x_2,x_4}.
